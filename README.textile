This is a simple Heroku app which pulls in the excellent JSChat gem and
connects to the JSChat server specified in config.json.

JSChat can be found here: http://github.com/alexyoung/jschat/

Please note that (as far as I know) you can't currently host the JSChat
*server* on Heroku, so this will have to be elsewhere.

h3. Config

Configuration consists solely of settings values in the file 'config.json'
as follows:

<pre>
{
    "port": integer
    "ip": "hostname or IP"
}
</pre>

An example configuration file would be as follows:

<pre>
{
    "port": 3001,
    "ip": "example.com"
}
</pre>
